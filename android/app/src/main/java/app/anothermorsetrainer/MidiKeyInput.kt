/**
 * Listens for key events from a MIDI keyer (the Vail Adapter or a BLE-MIDI key)
 * and reports each as a simple key-down/up, for hardware sending practice.
 *
 * The Vail Adapter sends MIDI note-on/off on channel 1: note 0 = straight key,
 * 1/20/61 = dit paddle, 2/21/62 = dah paddle; velocity > 0 = pressed. This
 * runs [MidiKeyer] against the clock: note 0 keys as it comes, and dit and dah,
 * which come only from a paddle with no keyer of its own, are timed in the
 * on-screen paddles' mode and speed.
 *
 * Port of MorseTrainerApp/MIDIInput.swift (CoreMIDI → `android.media.midi`).
 * Callbacks are marshaled to the main thread so they can drive Compose state.
