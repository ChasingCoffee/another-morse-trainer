/**
 * Listens for key events from a MIDI keyer (the Vail Adapter) and reports each
 * as a simple key-down/up, for hardware sending practice.
 *
 * The Vail Adapter sends MIDI note-on/off on channel 1: note 0 = straight key,
 * 1/20/61 = dit paddle, 2/21/62 = dah paddle; velocity > 0 = pressed. This
 * runs [MidiKeyer] against the clock: note 0 keys as it comes, and dit and dah,
 * which come only from a paddle with no keyer of its own (here a Vail Adapter
 * in Passthrough; the TinyMIDI is BLE-only), are timed in the on-screen
 * paddles' mode and speed.
 *
 * Desktop port of the Android `MidiKeyInput` (`android.media.midi` →
 * `javax.sound.midi`). Java Sound has no device-added callback, so
 * [MidiPorts.Watch] polls for hot-plug; everything else — the keyer, the
 * stuck-key release on unplug, the parser — is the Android code. Callbacks
 * are marshaled to the UI thread so they can drive Compose state.
